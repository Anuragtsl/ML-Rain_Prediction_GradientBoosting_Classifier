# ML-Rain_Prediction_GradientBoosting_Classifier

I have created Machine Learning Model With Gradient Boosting Classifier for Rain Predictions.

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Numpy](), [Pandas](), [Plotly](), [Sklearn]() and much more for Analysis, Vizualization and Model Development.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

**Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)!**

# Table of Contents

* Ingest the data and derive a few new variables
* Split data into train and test samples
* Set model parameters and train (fit) the model
* Predict class labels on train and test data using our model
* Generate model summary statistics
* Generate the 3D graph

***Follow notebook for more!***
